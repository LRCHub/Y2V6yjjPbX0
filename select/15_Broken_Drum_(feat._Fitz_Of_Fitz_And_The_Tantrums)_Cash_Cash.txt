My heart still beats like a broken drum
To the rhythm of a played out love song
Your voice still haunts like a melody
Even out of key, you were still a song to me
Turn it on, turn it up, you're my radio
Every line got me hooked, I can't let you go
Can we live? Can we love? In stereo
Even out of key, you were still a song to me
It was still a song to me, yeah, it was still a song to me
My heart still beats like a broken drum
My heart still beats like a broken drum
Drum, drum, drum, drum, drum, drum
No I can't let you go, go
No, no I can't let you go, oh
My heart still beats like a broken drum
To the rhythm of a played out love song
Your voice still haunts like a melody
Even out of key, you were still a song to me
Turn it on, turn it up, you're my radio
Every line got me hooked, I can't let you go
Can we live? Can we love? In stereo
Even out of key, you were still a song to me
It was still a song to me, yeah, it was still a song to me
My heart still beats like a broken drum
My heart still beats like a broken drum
To the rhythm of a played out love song
Your voice still haunts like a melody
Even out of key, you were still a song to me
