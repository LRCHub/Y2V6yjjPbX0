[00:13.30] Somebody save your soul 'cause you've been sinning in this city, I know
[00:17.12] Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losing control
[00:20.53] You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
[00:23.88] I want the good life, every good night, you're a hard one to hold
[00:56.38] 
[00:28.77] 'Cause you don't even know

[01:11.02] 'Cause I'm in need of something good right now
[01:14.68] We could be screaming 'til the sun comes out
[01:18.15] And when we wake, we'd be the only sound
[01:21.91] Get on my knees and say a prayer, James Brown
[01:26.03] That I can make your hands clap
[01:41.53] 
[01:34.51] That I can make your hands clap
[01:38.77] (Turn it up)

[01:47.09] I'm like a stranger, gimme danger, all your wrong and your right
[01:50.32] Secrets on Broadway to the freeway, you're a keeper of crimes
[01:53.93] Fear no conviction, grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine

[02:17.18] 'Cause I'm in need of something good right now
[02:20.35] We could be screaming 'til the sun comes out
[02:24.02] And when we wake we'd be the only sound
[02:27.41] Get on my knees and say a prayer, James Brown
[02:31.82] That I can make your hands clap
[02:47.32] 
[02:40.49] That I can make your hands clap
[02:55.99]
